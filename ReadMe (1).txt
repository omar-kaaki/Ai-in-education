Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive AI-based application designed for educational data analysis and modeling. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights and predictions based on user data, with components for exploratory data analysis, model creation, and deployment.
Installation
1. Clone the repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.
2. Set up a virtual environment: Create and activate a virtual environment for managing dependencies.
3. Install dependencies: Install all the required Python packages specified in the requirements.txt file.
4. Optional Docker setup: If preferred, build and run the application using Docker.
5. Run the application: Execute the main application script to start the project.
Usage
To use this project:
1. Train the model: Train the machine learning model using the provided dataset. The training process involves data preprocessing, model fitting, and saving the trained model.
2. Evaluate the model: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using a separate evaluation dataset. This step will assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
3. Model output: After evaluation, the trained model will be saved for future use in the models directory.
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:
* .env: Stores environment variables like API keys or database credentials. Ensure this file is configured correctly before running the project.
* app(last).py: The main application script, serving as the entry point for running the AI model and interacting with the user.
* data: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation, such as student_data.csv and evaluation_data.csv.
* notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
* src: Python source code for model training, evaluation, and utility functions.
