It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

 3. Install dependencies:
Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Usage

To use this project:

1. Train the model: You will need to train the machine learning model using the provided dataset. The training process will involve data preprocessing, model fitting, and saving the trained model.

2. Evaluate the model: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using a separate evaluation dataset. This step will assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

3. Model output: After evaluation, the trained model will be saved for future use.

Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:
